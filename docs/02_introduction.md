The ONT Cas9 sequencing kit allows the enrichment of genomic
regions of interest by amplifying target regions from adapters ligated to Cas9 cleavage sites.
The purpose of this workflow is to assess the effectiveness of such Cas9 enrichment, 
but it can be applied to other enrichment approaches. The workflow outputs
help assess the effectiveness of the enrichement strategy and can be used to diagnose issues such as poorly performing probes.

This workflow can be used for the following:

+ To obtain simple Cas9 enrichment sequencing summaries.
+ Statistics of the coverage of each target.
+ Plots of coverage across each target.
+ Identification of off-target hot-spots
